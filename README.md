# DueOh
 
 ## Project Proposal:
 ### Our main idea encompasses the combination of all the homework websites, such as Den Viterbi, Gradescope, Blackboard, and Vocareum into one. This website will contain all the deadlines that individual students have catered to each studentâ€™s schedule. It will also have the option to remind users when a deadline is coming up, a viewable calendar with assignment, and analytics. Links will also be available to redirect users to respective homework sites that the student desires.
